Version of LEAF-Toolbox/Source-Python jupyter lab that produces output JSON file of matchups
with feature collection of GBOV in situ data records.  For consistency cells in the notebook
with header comment 'LEAF-Toolbox' should not be changed as they are identical to LEAF-Toolbox/Source-Python jupyter lab.
Note that not all of the functions in these cells are called in the notebook but we preserve them for consistency.
Moreover, ideally, these cells should be updated if that code changes (not sure how to do this yet!)

Note you will need to ensure numpy and matplotlib are installed as well.
